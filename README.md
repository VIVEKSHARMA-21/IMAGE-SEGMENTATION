# IMAGE-SEGMENTATION
# Image Processing Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a set of image processing techniques implemented in Python. The toolkit includes the following functionalities:

- **GrabCut Algorithm:** Automatic image segmentation for foreground and background separation.
- **Color Masking:** Isolate specific colors in an image for focused analysis or object extraction.
- **Otsu Thresholding:** Automatic image binarization by finding an optimal threshold value.
- **Morphological Operations:** Shape-based image processing operations for tasks like noise reduction and object extraction.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-toolkit.git
   cd image-processing-toolkit
